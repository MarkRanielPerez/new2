<font color="4269f5"><center><b>What is android?</b></center></font color="4269f5">

<br>
		<!--1st paragraph-->
There are many operating systems that run on the devices, and Android is one the most famous. Android is an operating system which is mostly used for mobiles, but is also used in other devices. The main aim of this research paper is to identify Android, to know its history, usability, how secure it is, and to manifest its performance. Finally, Android appears to the most used OS compared to others, and it has the largest number of apps according to statistics. Android has a wide range of applications to choose. The current number of Android apps in the market as the figure bellow shows is: 1,214,489.


<br><br>

		<!--2nd paragraph-->
Manufacturers did not make Android only for Cell Phones, but also to many other devices such as: Cell phones, tablets, desktop phones, HD TV or Google TV, Android cars, Washing machines, Microwave ovens, Set-top boxes for satellite, Cable TV and Routers. Android wants to be among the safest and most secured operating system in the world. However, making the source code available to everyone indirectly invites the attention of hackers. To prevent that from happening, Android provides key security features.  Android is a powerful operating system which supports a large number of applications in Smart Phones, tablets and other devices. In dictionary it means an automaton or a robot which looks like a human being.

<font color="4269f5"><center><b>What is iOS?</b></center></font color="4269f5">

<br>
		<!--3rd paragraph-->
iOS runs on all models of iPhones and its primary rival is Google’s Android. iOS was first released alongside the iPhone in 2007 and began running on iPads and models of iPod Touch alike. Since then, iPod Touch has somewhat fallen by the wayside and iPad’s now run on a larger screen-friendly version of iOS, named iPadOS – even if it remains fairly similar. iOS popularised functions like zooming in and out as well as the feature that’s been around so long now you can’t believe it didn’t always exist – the swiping gesture. Over the course of 13 years, iOS has greatly developed in several areas. The App Store has become more prolific than many would have imagined, iOS took swiping even further by ditching the physical home button and we’ve seen deeper integration with Apple’s own apps like Apple Music, Podcasts, TV and more. These changes have come via another feature that is of significant appeal to iOS users – frequent updates. Apple is known for supporting its devices over many years with regular updates – from solving bugs and security issues to big releases that bring new and exciting features.

<center><b><font color="4269f5">Advantages of Android OS over Apple iOS</font color="4269f5"></b></center>

<br>
		<!--4th paragraph-->
Devices running the Android Operating System are versatile such that the UI (User Interface) enables users to multitask functions and multiple purposes. The versatility enables users to perform two functions at a time without having to close other applications. On the contrary, the Apple iOS allows users to execute one function at a time and exit running applications when they need to open another application. The Android second advantage is that the Google Android OS supports several Social Integration and Google functionalities and apps such as Google Play, Gmail, Google Maps, G-talk, YouTube, and Google Plus. The Apple iOS is limited to selected social integration and functionalities from the iTunes store. Third, users can access a variety of third-party applications without stringent rules and restrictions compared to the Apple iOS. Lastly, the Android OS runs on any android supported device because of its low system requirements and it does not require the installation of additional drivers(Ian, 2011).

<br><br>
		<!--5th paragraph-->
Google's Android and Apple's iOS are operating systems used primarily in mobile technology, such as smartphones and tablets. Android is now the world's most commonly used smartphone platform and is used by many different phone manufacturers. iOS is only used on Apple devices, such as the iPhone.

<br><br>
		<!--6th paragraph-->
<font color="5aa832"><b>Comparison of Apple IOS and Android OS</b></font color="5aa832"> Nowadays, smartphones have been an irreplaceable and indispensable part of peoples daily life. What makes the smartphones so smart is the OS, in other words, the operation system. The OS is the basic and soul of a smartphone, which means if the phone is the body, then the OS is the neural network and intellectual system to control the body. Among diverse operation systems, Apple IOS and Android OS are the most outstanding, they have occupied about 96 percent of the whole global smartphone market together. They are both widely used and liked by individuals but they also have own advantages and disadvantages.

<br>
Apple smartphones and tablets do not support expandable memory but android devices come with expandable memory option. If you have a lot of data to store then you can attach an external memory card to expand your phone memory. You can store lot of books, movies and songs in the extended memory card.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Variety of mobile models to choose from:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
Android OS can run on a wide range of devices i.e. HTC, Samsung, OPPO, Huawei, Motorola, Sony Ericson and many others. You can choose any low-cost mobile or middle range mobile easily. Some android mobiles are costly too but it all depends upon your budget.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Support large screens at an affordable price:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
If you compare large screens Apple devices then android is giving you large screen devices at good prices. Android is also giving updates to all resolution screens and is adaptive.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Run many apps at the same time:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
If you have a good specification phone then you can smoothly run multiple apps at the same time. You can listen to music while using Instagram or Facebook.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Multiple widgets on screen:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
You can choose native widgets or 3rd party widgets to appear on the screen. For example, displaying temperature and clock widgets gives you information all the time when you switch on your phone.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Foldable devices:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
Now new android 10 version support foldable devices. With the passage of time, technology is changing and android is also adapting with the changes in the mobile world.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Large community support:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
There are a huge community of developers and users of android. So if you have any issue in the code or want to check authenticity of app then you can easily do this. You can check if the app is real by checking its reviews on google play store.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Addition and removal of unwanted features:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
Android is adding new features in every release and removing old features that are not favourable to the users.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Android is Open source:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
Android is licensed under apache. Mobile companies change the code of android to make UI change a little bit. Developers have also access to the core code and can make changes to it.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Cloud storage:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
Gmail and other google products use cloud storage that means you can sync many devices with same google account. 15 GB of cloud storage comes free with every account that is enough for normal users.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Android developers have high job demands:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
As there are millions of apps and to maintain and develop new apps, developers are needed. Android developers have high demand and there are a lot of resources on internet to get help in the code.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Restoring and backup of apps:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
With the new OS, apps can restore and make backup of their data. This feature help apps to recover from any bad update or user behaviour.
<br><br>

<br>

<ol><ins><center><b><font color="4269f5">Disadvantages of Android</font color="4269f5"></b></center></ins>

<br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Apps run in the background:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
In the older version of Android, most apps always run in the background and come to foreground as they wish. But in new version of android apps cannot automatically come to foreground. As some apps run in the background then it consumes mobile battery and your device battery vanishes quickly.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Developers have a tough time:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
Learning and developing android apps is hard because there are a variety of screen sizes and to make app adaptive to all screen sizes is challenging for the developers. Developers have to write more code and is difficult to troubleshoot the app for final delivery. It is also difficult to make complex apps and doing advanced animation is hard.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Low specification mobiles run slow:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
As android is a very large operating system that consumes lot of storage and some default apps also comes with operating system so low specification devices run slow. If you install many apps in these devices then your mobile will become unresponsive or heat up quickly.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Virus protection:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
Android is not good at virus protection. Users have rights to download and install apps from other external websites and these apps may contain a virus and stole your data and information. It is also noticed that some apps in google play store contain a virus.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Many ads in apps:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
Most of the android apps are free to use but they come with lot of ads that display on app screen or ads display when you perform any action in the app. This is irritating for users and users have to buy license for the app to remove ads or uninstall the app.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Not friendly with old people:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
Old people have a difficult time using android devices because of advanced touch screens. They may have an eyesight problem or have not used android mobile before.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Google account needed:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
For installing apps from google play store you need Gmail account. You also need a google account to use other Google products. If you forget Gmail id then your device can be locked and for unlocking you need to get your Gmail account.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Bad quality for apps:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
Majority of apps in the app store have poor quality and some apps only want to earn money by displaying ads and they have no use for the users. Some apps are not updated for many years and this will affect users which update their operating system.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>The new app idea is difficult:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
For developers, there are fewer chances that they make app which is not already present. As all types of apps are already published in the app store so new companies and developers have difficult time entering the android market.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Google is strict to app developers:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
If Google finds any issue in your app then it will behave very strictly and also terminate your developer account.

<br><br>

<font color="5aa832"><b>Conclusion:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
If you want to buy mobile within your budget then android is the best option to choose from. There are all types of devices available. iOS too has some disadvantages and it all depends upon your budget. In my opinion android is best.

<ol><ins><center><b><font color="4269f5">Disadvantages of iOS</font color="4269f5"></b></center></ins>

<br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Same icons:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
iPhone has similar icons on the home screen and these icons have the same design as previous versions. The home screen looks the same when you upgrade iOS to new version i.e you will see the same style of icons on the home screen.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Very simple:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
iOS devices are very simple in look and you cannot use as your computer. But if you compare this with android devices then you can perform your computer work in devices also.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Apps are costly:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
The apps are costly in price and there is no widget support for the apps. If you compare apps with android then most of the android apps are free to use.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Limited devices:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
iOS only runs on Apple devices and users have to keep stick with similar look and feel of the UI. As you know android has a vast range of devices and each device has its custom UI due to customization of android.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Not open source:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
iOS is not open-source that mean you cannot customize and cannot use iOS on devices other than Apple devices. If you consider android then it can be customized easily by any mobile company like Samsung, Huawei or HTC.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>App approval:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
It is very difficult for the app to get approved. Developers have to wait for at least 7 days for app approval and most of the time app does not get approved.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>No SD card:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
iPhone and iPad do not provide SD card. If you want to increase your storage then you have to buy a new device that has more storage.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Battery timing:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
If you use 3G/4G on your iPhone device then your battery will vanish quickly. This is because apps like Instagram and Pinterest use high data and thus consumes more battery.
<br><br>


<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Repairing is expensive:</b></font color="5aa832">
<br>
If your device gets any hardware or software problem then it is very expensive to repair the device. The reason behind this is there are few repair shops for iPhone devices.
<br><br>

<li><font color="5aa832"><b>Supports single sim:</b></font color="5aa832">
